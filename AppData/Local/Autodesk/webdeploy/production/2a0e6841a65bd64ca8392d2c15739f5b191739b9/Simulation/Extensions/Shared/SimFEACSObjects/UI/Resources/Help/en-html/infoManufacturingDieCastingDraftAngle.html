<div id="infoManufacturingDieCastingDraftAngle">
    <p>Specifies the angle, or amount of slope, given to walls, cores, and other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy ejection of the casting from the die. The draft angle is also known as the draft.</p>
    <p>All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for proper ejection of the casting from the die.</p>

    <p>As the alloy cools and shrinks towards the features that for the inside component surfaces, it fits more tightly on the inside casting. Make sure the design of the casting has sufficient draft for easier casting removal.</p>
