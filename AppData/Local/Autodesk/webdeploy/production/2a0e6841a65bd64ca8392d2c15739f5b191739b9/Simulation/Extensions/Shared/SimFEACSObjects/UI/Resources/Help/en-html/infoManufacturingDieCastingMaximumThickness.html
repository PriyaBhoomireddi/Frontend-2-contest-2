<div id="infoManufacturingDieCastingMaximumThickness">
    <p>Specifies the maximum thickness that you anticipate using for the part. Typical wall thicknesses depend on the size of the part, its application, its configuration, and the alloy used.</p>
    <p>Minimize wall thickness variations around the casting for better metal flow and complete casting filling. Different wall thicknesses can result in different rates of cooling along the casting walls, and variation in the dimensions of your part.</p>
    <p>The solver uses the maximum thickness, in conjunction with other constraints and objectives such as draft angle, ejection direction, stiffness, safety factor and target mass. In some cases, the resultant thickness may exceed the set maximum thickness value, so that other constraints can be satisfied.</p>
